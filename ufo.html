    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
        Hello my name is Kent and I am a student at Bridgewater State University. My major is Math and I am considering in
        applying two minors of Computer Science and Statistics. My favorite hobbies are longboarding and video games. My favorite
        food is sushi, and I have two cats and one kitten named Teriyaki, Migos, and Marida. One common trait about my cats is that
        they are both black cats.
